# Machine Learning with Python
This repository contains materials, projects, and notes from the "Machine Learning and Data Science with Python" course I recently completed. The course provided an in-depth and practical understanding of key concepts and techniques in machine learning and data science, using the Python programming language.
## About the Course
The course covered a wide range of fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning and data science, with a focus on the practical application of techniques in Python. You can access it (language: portuguese - BR) at [Machine Learning e Data Science with Python de A a Z](https://www.udemy.com/share/101rzE3@qAgkuTAq5jlvc_AhonjRj6fIVgDix39yzf8fw0xqQ4t9UScBOqSCME1b1kPFDYW6Ag==/). For additional resources, you can also check out the [Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/share/103HFM3@iTcHHoudervjdP5T7dw567VujRj3kjcHaxw7CsYY5xx4_nb0tS3T1lUCrQwnGhAfsQ==/) course (language: english - USA).
### 1. Data Manipulation and Cleaning
The quality of data is crucial for the effectiveness of machine learning models. I used techniques for data manipulation and cleaning using Pandas, dealing with missing data, duplicates, and data transformations to prepare suitable datasets for analysis.
### 2. Data Visualization
Effective visualizations help to better understand data and communicate insights clearly. I used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly to create graphs and plots at high and low level that reveal patterns and trends in the data.
### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms
I explored various machine learning algorithms, from basic to advanced, including:
- **Linear and Logistic Regression**: Models for predicting continuous values and categories;
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Ensemble techniques to improve predictive accuracy;
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: A robust algorithm for classification and regression;
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: An instance-based model for classification;
- **K-Means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm for data segmentation;
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: An introduction to neural network concepts and implementation;
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for working with text, including tokenization, stemming, and language models;
- **Time Series Analysis**: Methods for forecasting sequential data.
### 4. Project Implementation
Throughout the course, we developed several practical projects that apply the concepts learned to real-world problems, including creating predictive models, data analysis, and developing machine learning applications.
